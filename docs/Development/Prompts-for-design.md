I understand you need the prompts in English. Here are quality prompts for generating images for your driving school website using Leonardo.ai, specifically for categories A and B:

**Prompts for Category A (motorcycles):**

1. "Professional instructor in protective gear teaching a student the basics of motorcycle control on a specialized training ground, sunny day, clear road markings, modern motorcycle, safety-focused, training session, photorealistic style"

2. "Group of driving school students studying motorcycle mechanics in a modern bright classroom, interactive whiteboard with diagrams, instructor pointing at parts of an actual motorcycle, professional lighting, educational atmosphere"

3. "Driving school graduate receiving their Category A license, standing next to a motorcycle, holding a driver's license, smiling, modern driving school building in the background, professional photography, clear day"

4. "Motorcyclists performing exercises on a training ground, slalom cones, clear markings, various motorcycle models, instructors observing, safe learning environment, wide-angle shot"

5. "First-person view of a motorcycle handlebar during training, dashboard, road ahead with markings, hands in protective gloves on the handlebars, high-quality image, realistic style"

**Prompts for Category B (passenger cars):**

1. "Driving instructor explaining car control principles to a student behind the wheel of a modern dual-control training vehicle, city street, daytime, calm environment, photorealistic style"

2. "Spacious modern driving school classroom with students studying traffic rules, interactive displays showing road situations, professional teacher, bright lighting, educational atmosphere"

3. "Driving school student successfully performing a 'parallel parking' exercise in a training area, instructor standing nearby observing, parking space markings, training car with driving school logo, clear day"

4. "Graduation at a driving school, diverse group of students of different ages holding certificates, training cars and driving school building in the background, celebratory atmosphere, professional group photo"

5. "View from inside a training vehicle looking at the road through the windshield, student's hands on the steering wheel, dashboard, rearview mirror reflecting the instructor, urban landscape ahead, realistic photography style"

Each of these prompts is designed to generate high-quality, realistic images that will look great on your driving school website and effectively represent training for categories A and B. They include key elements of driver training, safety, and professionalism.

I recommend adding technical parameters in Leonardo.ai for better results: "--ar 16:9" for widescreen images or "--ar 4:3" for more standard proportions, and "--v 5.1" to use the latest model version (if available).
