I've restructured the Home page following Stephen Wendel's Action Funnel framework, which creates a clear path to action through five distinct stages:

1. AWARENESS Stage

- Hero section with compelling value proposition

- Quick stats to build immediate credibility

- Visual hierarchy to capture attention

- Clear introduction to the driving school

1. CONSIDERATION Stage

- "Why Choose Us" section

- Advantages component

- Focus on building trust and understanding

- Clear value proposition

1. EVALUATION Stage

- Social proof from real students

- Detailed course structure

- Helps users evaluate if this is the right choice

- Builds confidence through transparency

1. DECISION Stage

- Package comparison

- Gift card options

- Helps with final decision-making

- Provides incentives for action

1. ACTION Stage

- Testimonials for final social proof

- Strong call-to-action

- Clear next steps

- Sense of urgency

Key improvements:

1. Clear visual hierarchy with section backgrounds

2. Progressive disclosure of information

3. Multiple touchpoints for conversion

4. Consistent spacing and layout

5. Strong visual cues for each stage

6. Clear CTAs at each stage

7. Better content organization

Would you like me to:

1. Add animations to enhance the funnel flow?

2. Create a sticky CTA that follows the user?

3. Add more interactive elements to each stage?

4. Implement A/B testing variations for the CTAs?
