# Spectrum of Thinking Interventions

The _Spectrum of Thinking Interventions_ provides a structure for understanding the different types of decision-making processes by illustrating how our minds would respond in a _default, lowest energy way_, if we didn't consciously do something different. This spectrum ranges from situations requiring minimal thought to those demanding intensive thinking, and includes the mechanisms ("interventions") that our minds will likely use.

- **Habits:** Triggering a learned routine based on familiar cues
- **Other intuitive responses:** Used in familiar or semi-familiar situations, with responses based on past experiences
- **Active mindset or self-concept:** Used in ambiguous scenarios with multiple possible interpretations
- **Heuristics:** Used in situations requiring conscious attention, but where decisions can be made more easily
- **Focused, conscious calculation:** Used in unfamiliar scenarios or crucial decisions where deliberate focus is needed

With this spectrum in mind, it is essential as a UX designer to leverage on the mind's decision-making process, analyze which mechanisms are most applicable to your target users and design the most accessible and effective solutions.
